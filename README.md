# my-nvim-configs

Repo to save my nvim configs. (I'm still a noob on it)

some of the configs are from [here](https://www.manualdocodigo.com.br/vim-basico/)

## Things to do

Config for html/css/js/ts/jsx/tsx
Add/test prettier/eslint and sonarlint (if possible), format on save and some key binds

Change the theme for a high contrast one, I use one on VS code and love it
